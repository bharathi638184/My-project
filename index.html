<h2>CINEMA</h2>
<p>Cinema is a very popular form of entertainment.
It is difficult to find an area or locality where
there is no cinema hall. Cinema halls provide us 
with group or family entertainment. Cinema has a 
refreshing effect. After a hard dayâ€™s work people 
visit cinema halls and refresh their minds. Cinema
presents us with food of thought. In cinema, we 
find many real-life events and matters that require
serious thinking. Cinema can present social problems
and possible solutions for them. Thus it can be a
means of positive change in our society. Cinema is
a very strong medium for creating social awareness.
Necessary information and instructions can be 
imparted by cinema slides for creating social awareness.
Thus it can be a tool for making our ignorant people
aware of problems like AIDS, population explosion,
pure drinking water, healthcare, sanitation, arsenic
pollution, water pollution, air pollution, sound 
pollution, adulterations, unemployment, and natural 
disasters like flood, earthquake, cyclone, etc. 
Through cinema, we can also learn many things about
our history and geography.
